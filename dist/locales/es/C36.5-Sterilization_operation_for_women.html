        <p>A tubal ligation is a safe operation in which a trained health worker opens the skin near the belly button, and then cuts and ties the tubes that carry eggs to the womb. It takes only about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>The operation doesn't change a woman’s menstruation or her ability to have sex or feel sexual pleasure.</p>
        <p>Tubal ligation does not protect against STIs, including HIV. You will still need a condom to protect against these infections.</p>

                  <p>A method of sterilization called <em>Essure</em> places a small piece of metal in the Fallopian tubes to create scars that block the release of a woman's eggs. However, this method has generated many serious problems and is no longer available in some countries. No one should use it.</p>
