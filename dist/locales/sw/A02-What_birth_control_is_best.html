            <p>You might have other needs and concerns. For example: Will you be able
            to keep it private? If you have to go to a clinic regularly to get it, will the people there treat you respectfully? Are you breastfeeding? Do you have all the children you want? Do you never want children? Nobody knows what you want better than you.</p>
