        <p>A <strong>cervical cap</strong> is a small silicone cup a woman puts into her vagina before sex. It prevents pregnancy by covering the cervix so the man’s sperm can't get into the woman’s womb.</p>
        <p>A cervical cap only provides protection when it is inside you and it works best when you also use spermicide. A cervical cap lasts for many years.</p>

                  <p>With clean hands, put about a &#188; teaspoon of spermicide inside the cap and also on the top side of the cap, beneath the removal strap. With the strap side down, squeeze the rim of the cap together and gently insert the cap inside you until it covers the cervix.</p>
                  <p>Put the cervical cap in before sex, even hours before if you want. To be protected from pregnancy, leave it in for at least 6 hours after sex, but no more than 48 hours. Remove it by pushing gently on the dome to break the suction, then crooking a finger under the removal strap to pull it out. Clean with mild soap and water and let dry in the air. </p>
