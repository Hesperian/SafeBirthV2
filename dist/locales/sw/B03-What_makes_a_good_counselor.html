        A good counselor provides information a woman needs and helps a woman make a good decision. She won’t act in a biased way or bully a woman into accepting what the counselor thinks is best. She will give her full attention to the woman she is counseling, listen to her questions and do her best to answer them respectfully. She will ask the woman questions to make sure she understands the woman’s situation and concerns completely.

        It is up to each woman to make her own decision about what birth control to use and when to use it. Understanding her options and making these decisions herself will make her more successful at preventing unwanted pregnancy.

      <p>It takes time and practice to become a good counselor. A good counselor knows how to listen, to establish a bond of trust, and to understand the feelings and the reality of the person she is counseling. A good counselor is flexible. She doesn't judge the person she is counseling, but helps her solve her problems in the way that will work best for her.
