        <p>A vasectomy is a simple operation which cuts the tubes that carry the sperm from the testicles to the penis. A trained health worker can do the operation in any health center in only a few minutes.</p>
        <p>The operation doesn't change a man’s ability to have sex or to feel sexual pleasure. He still gets an erection and ejaculates semen, but there are no sperm in the semen. Because the tubes may contain sperm for up to 12 weeks after the operation, use another method of family planning during that time.</p>
        <p>Vasectomy does not protect against STIs, including HIV. You will still need a condom to protect against these infections.</p>
