        <p>To use any of these fertility awareness methods, a woman must understand which days she is fertile every month by checking the calendar and monitoring her body. To not get pregnant, during her fertile days she either must not have sexual intercourse or use a barrier method.</p>
        <p>Because there are no costs or side effects, fertility awareness methods can be used by women who can't or don't want to use other methods, or when other methods are not available.</p>

                  <p>A woman’s ovaries release one egg each month, about 14 days before her menstruation begins. The egg lives for about 24 hours (1 day and 1 night). A man’s sperm can live up to 2 days inside a woman’s body.</p>
                  <p>Because every woman's body is different, it is difficult to know exactly when an egg has been or will be released. To avoid pregnancy there are 11 days each month when you should not have sex. The fertility awareness methods help you identify those 11 days.</p>
                  <p>To make fertility awareness methods more effective:</p>
                  <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Use both the counting days method and the mucus method at the same time.</li>
                    <li>Use condoms whenever you aren't sure if you are fertile, or don't have sex.</li>
                    <li>Have sex only on the days between the end of the fertile time and your next menstruation.</li>
