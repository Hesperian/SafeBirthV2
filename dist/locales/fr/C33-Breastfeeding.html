        <p>Breastfeeding can prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg. This method doesn't cost anything, but <strong>it is only effective when all 3</strong> of these are true:</p>
        <ol class="num-list">
          <li>Your baby is less than 6-months old.</li>
          <li>You haven't had your menstruation since giving birth.</li>
          <li>You are giving your baby only breastmilk, and feeding it whenever it is hungry, day and night, with no more than 6 hours between feedings. Your baby doesn't sleep through the night without feeding.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Use another method of family planning that is safe with breastfeeding as soon as <strong>any</strong> of the above aren't true. </p>
