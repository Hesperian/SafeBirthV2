        Women everywhere deserve access to a full spectrum of birth control options. Unfortunately, that isn’t always the reality.
        If you live in an area where a specific method isn’t available and you are using the “Method Chooser” tool with women,
        you can deselect each method not available in your area so it won’t be suggested as a possible choice.
        If things change and a method later becomes available, you can reselect it as an option. Deselecting a method here only
        removes it from the results in the “Method Chooser.”
