        <p>The <strong>diaphragm</strong> is a shallow cup made of soft rubber or thin silicone that a woman puts into her vagina before sex. It prevents pregnancy by covering the cervix so that the man’s sperm can't get into the woman’s womb.</p>
        <p>A health worker who has been trained to do pelvic exams can examine the woman to find the right size diaphragm for her. The diaphragm only provides protection when it is inside you and works best when you also use spermicide. A diaphragm can last for many years.</p>

                  <p>With clean hands, put about a teaspoon of spermicide inside the diaphragm, squeeze the sides together, and gently insert it deep into your vagina so it covers the cervix. The diaphragm can be put in the vagina hours before or just before sex. To be protected from pregnancy, leave it in for at least 6 hours after sex, but no more than 24 hours. Then remove it, clean it with mild soap and water, and let it dry in the air. </p>
