        <p>With the Counting Days method, you don't have sexual intercourse during the time you might be fertile. This method will work for you only if you have regular cycles of between 26 and 32 days. This means that the time from the first day of one menstruation to the first day of your next menstruation is at least 26 days, and no more than 32 days.</p>
        <p>If you have cycles of different lengths, you can easily get pregnant using this method. It is common to have a cycle of a different length when you are sick or feeling a lot of stress. So if you are sick or feeling stress, it is best to use a different family planning method until you are well and you can rely on your cycle being normal.</p>

                  <p>Count the number of days of your menstrual cycle for a few months to be sure that it is regular. If it is, count 8 days from the first day of your period. From that day, you can't have sexual intercourse for 11 days, that is, no unprotected sex from the 8th day of your cycle through the 19th day of your cycle. If you do have sex during this time, you must use another method of family planning.</p>
                  <p>You can use beads, a calendar, or some other tool to help you remember which are your fertile days.</p>
