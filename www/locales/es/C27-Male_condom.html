        <p>The male condom is a narrow bag of thin rubber that the man wears on his penis during sex. Because the man’s semen collects in the condom, his sperm can't enter the woman’s body. In addition to preventing pregnancy, condoms provide protection against STIs and HIV while other forms of contraception don't. A condom can be used alone or with any other birth control (except female condoms). Condoms can be bought at many pharmacies and markets, and may be available for free at health clinics and through HIV prevention programs.</p>

                  <p>As you open the package, be careful not to rip the condom. Don't use a condom if its package is torn or dried out, or if the condom is stiff or sticky. It won't protect you from pregnancy or STIs. </p>
                  <p>The condom must be put on the man’s penis when it is hard, but before it touches the woman’s genitals. If he rubs his penis on the woman’s genitals or goes into her vagina without a condom, he can make the woman pregnant or can give her an STI, even if he doesn't ejaculate.</p>

                  <p>Squeeze the tip of the condom and unroll it all the way over the hard penis. The loose condom tip will hold the man’s sperm. If you don't leave space for the sperm, the condom might break.</p>
                  <p>After climaxing, while the penis is still hard, the man should hold the rim of the condom to keep it on his penis while he pulls out of the woman’s vagina. Then take the condom off the penis. Use a new condom each time you have sex.</p>
