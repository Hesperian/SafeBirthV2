      <p>You can think about these questions by yourself or discuss them with another person who is also using the app to become a better counselor.</p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>What do you think about how each counselor interacted with the women seeking birth control?</li>
        <li>Which counselor did you think was most helpful? Why?</li>
        <li>Which counselor do you think best responded to the concerns and needs of the woman she was counseling? Which counselor did not listen to or respond as well to the woman she was counseling?</li>
        <li>Protecting against STIs, including HIV, is very important everywhere. Do you think Zena and/or Amy was effective at communicating this? Why or why not? What could she have done better?</li>
        <li> When a counselor does not treat a woman respectfully, she may not return again for counseling, or worse, she may not get the important care she needs. Give some examples of disrespectful counseling that bothered you. How could the counseling have been more respectful?</li>
        <li>A counselorâ€™s own attitudes and opinions about sex can make it difficult for her to provide respectful, nonjudgmental advice to the person she is counseling. Give some examples of how the opinions of the counselors influenced how they responded. How did this prevent the counselor from providing the woman with the best advice? How did this interfere with letting the woman make her own best choice? What should the counselor have said instead to keep her own opinions from interfering?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>HELP US! How could this section be improved? What other questions do you think should be on this list?</p>
