        <p>Combination pills include both the hormones estrogen and progestin, similar to the hormones produced in your body. Different brands contain different amounts of each hormone. Some brands change the amounts of either hormone in each pill once or twice during the month&mdash;you can usually tell because the color of the pill changes. Different amounts of hormones cause different side effects, so you may find that some brands of combination pills work better for you than others.

                  <p>If you are sure you aren't pregnant, you can start taking the pill any time. Pills will not prevent pregnancy until you have been taking them for about a week. So during the first 7 days after starting birth control pills, use condoms or avoid sex.</p>
                  <p>You must take 1 pill every day to prevent pregnancy, even if you don't have sex that day. Try to take your pill at the same time each day. If you keep the pills where you sleep, it may help you remember to take one each night before bed or first thing when you get up in the morning.</p>
                  <p>Most combination pills come in packets of 28 or 21 pills.</p>
                  <p><strong>28-day pack:</strong> Take the pills with hormones for 21 days, then for 7 days take the reminder pills (the extra pills in the packet have no hormones) or take no pills. You will have bleeding each month during those 7 days like a normal period.</p>
                  <p><strong>21-day pack:</strong> Take 1 pill every day for 21 days&mdash;the whole packet. Then don't take a pill for 7 days. Then start a new packet.</p>
                  <p><strong>If you forget to take a pill:</strong></p>
                  <p>If you forget to take 1 or 2 pills, take 1 pill as soon as you remember. Then take the next pill at the regular time. This may mean that you take 2 pills in one day.</p>
                  <p>If you forget to take 3 pills, 3 days in a row, take 1 pill right away. Then take 1 pill each day at the regular time. Use condoms or don't have sex until you start your period or until you have taken a pill for 7 days in a row.</p>
