        <p>There are ways to have sex&mdash;where the penis isn't in the vagina at all&mdash;that don't cause pregnancy. Oral sex (mouth on genitals) and sexual touch (touching the genitals or other parts of the body) are sexual activities many couples enjoy. They have no risk of pregnancy and a very low risk of passing HIV and other STIs.</p>
        <p>Anal sex does not cause pregnancy, although it can pass HIV and other STIs very easily.</p>
        <p>Abstinence means avoiding all sexual intercourse&mdash;a man’s penis inside a woman’s vagina. Abstinence is the surest way to prevent pregnancy, although in practice it has a very high failure rate.</p>
