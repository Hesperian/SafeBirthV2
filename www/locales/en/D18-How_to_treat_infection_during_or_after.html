        <p>The mini pill contains only 1 hormone, progestin, though different brands contain different amounts. Because different amounts of progestin cause different side effects, you may find that some brands of mini pills work better for you than others. </p>

                  <p>Take your first pill on the first day of your period. Then take 1 pill at the same time every day, even if you don't have sex. When you finish a packet, start your new packet the next day, even if you haven't had any bleeding. Don't skip a day. Every pill in the packet has the same amount of progestin.</p>
                  <p>If you take the mini pill even a few hours late, or if you forget 1 day's pill, you can become pregnant. If you miss a pill, take it as soon as you remember. Then take the next pill at the regular time, even if it means taking 2 pills in one day. Use condoms or don't have sex for 7 days. You may bleed a little if you miss your mini pill or take it late.</p>
