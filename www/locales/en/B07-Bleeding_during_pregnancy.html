      <p>A role play is when you take on the personality of a character, like one of the counselors in the interactive section you just read, and you try to think and respond as she would. These work best with 2 people who can take turns in the different roles.</p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Pretend you are one of the counselors. Ask the other person to read the questions asked by one of the women seeking birth control. Answer each question as best you can. Then ask the person pretending to be the woman you counseled to say:
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>how your answers made her feel (listened to; misunderstood; respected; etc.)</li>
            <li>if she got the information she was looking for</li>
            <li>how you might have answered the questions better</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Pretend you are the counselor named Anna. Ask the other person to pretend to be the counselor named Zena. Share with Zena some ways she could have better responded to the woman who came to her looking for birth control. What are some things she could do to become a better counselor? Allow Zena to respond to Annaâ€™s suggestions. Remember: Zena and Anna are friends so you must be gentle with each other.</li>
        <li>Make up your own situation of a woman seeking birth control information from a counselor. Take turns pretending to be the counselor and the woman looking for help.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>HELP US! How could this section be improved? Do you have other ideas for difficult counseling scenarios like counseling a couple or talking with men?</p>
