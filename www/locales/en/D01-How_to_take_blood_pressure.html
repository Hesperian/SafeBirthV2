        <p>The vaginal ring is a small plastic ring you put into your vagina. It slowly releases estrogen and progestin. Protection lasts for 1 month, then you replace it. </p>

                  <p>With clean hands, squeeze the ring and gently insert it deep into your vagina. The ring is placed correctly if you can't feel it when you walk or move around. The ring can be left in the vagina during sex. Or you can remove it, but it must be put back in within 3 hours to continue giving protection. (If it is out for more than 3 hours, use a condom or avoid sex for 7 days.)</p>
                  <p>After 3 weeks, remove the ring by putting your finger into your vagina and pulling it out. Menstruation will happen during week 4. Then insert a new one.</p>
                  <p>If you don't want to menstruate, it is safe to leave the ring in for 4 weeks and then replace it right away. You may have a little spotting at first, but the ring remains effective against pregnancy and your body remains healthy.</p>
