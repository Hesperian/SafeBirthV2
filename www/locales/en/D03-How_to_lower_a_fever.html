        <p>A female condom is a thin plastic tube which fits into the vagina and covers the outer lips of the vulva. It can be put in the vagina any time before sex. The female condom is designed to be used only once without breaking, but if you don't have any others, it can be gently cleaned and reused up to 5 times. The female condom should not be used with a male condom at the same time. Condoms protect against both pregnancy and STIs, including HIV.</p>
