        <p>The copper IUD is a small piece of copper and plastic that is put in the uterus. It makes the uterus a place where pregnancy can’t happen. The copper IUD can last up to 12 years. The most common side effect is heavier, more painful menstruation&mdash;uncomfortable, but not dangerous, and usually lessens after a few months.</p>

                  <p>The best time to have an IUD put in is during menstruation, when you are certain you aren't pregnant. An IUD must be inserted and removed by a specially trained health worker. After childbirth, it is best to wait 6 weeks for the womb to return to its normal size and shape before getting an IUD.</p>
                  <p>Check the IUD strings after each menstruation to make sure it is in place. Here’s how: wash your hands, squat, and reach as far as you can into your vagina with 2 fingers. Feel for the IUD strings, but don't pull them. If you can feel them, the IUD is in the correct place. If you cannot, the IUD may have slipped out of place and will no longer prevent pregnancy&mdash;see a health worker.</p>
