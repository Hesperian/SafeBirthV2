        <p>There are several general types of contraception (outlined below), and often different kinds within each category. What they all have in common is that they prevent pregnancy, which means you can plan your life instead of leaving pregnancy and its responsibilities up to chance.</p>
        <p>How they differ is in how much attention and action using them demands from you, and the sorts of side effects they bring.</p>
        <p>Your life circumstances, your body, and your likes and dislikes will determine which method is best for you. Nobody but you can decide that, and learning about the different methods can help you make an informed decision.</p>

                  <p>Barrier methods prevent pregnancy by blocking the sperm from reaching the egg. They don't change the way a woman’s or man’s body works, and they cause very few side effects. Barrier methods are safe for a breastfeeding woman. Male and female condoms are barrier methods and the only methods that also protect against STIs, including HIV. When a woman using a barrier method wants to become pregnant, she simply stops using it. Barrier methods include:</p>

                  <p>For barrier methods to work, they must be used every time you have sex.</p>
                  <p class="content-title">Side effects</p>
                  <p>Barrier methods have very few side effects. Rarely, a person may be allergic to the latex in male condoms, the silicone in diaphragms or cervical caps, the polyurethane in sponges or female condoms, or the chemicals in spermicides. Allergic reactions to these include itching, burning or dryness in the vagina.</p>

                  <p>Some family planning methods rely on a man and a woman avoiding sexual intercourse during a woman’s fertile days when she can become pregnant. Others depend on having sex in a way that makes pregnancy less likely. Methods that rely on behaviors include:</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>Behavioral methods are among the least effective of all family planning methods because it can be hard to always follow their rules perfectly, and because body changes can be sometimes hard to distinguish.They often result in unintended pregnancy.</p>

                  <p class="content-title">Side effects</p>
                  <p>These methods don't work unless both you and your partner are committed to follow them all the time. Also, Fertility awareness methods won't work if you have an irregular menstrual cycle.

                  <p>Hormonal family planning methods contain hormones similar to those naturally in a woman’s body. Hormonal methods change the amounts of these hormones in the body to “fool” it into thinking it is already pregnant, and prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg. The hormones also thicken the mucus at the opening of the womb, preventing sperm from getting in. When you stop using a hormonal method, your ovaries begin releasing eggs again and you can get pregnant.</p>

                  <p class="item-title"><strong>Who should avoid all hormonal family planning?</strong></p>
                  <p>Women with breast cancer or uterine cancer should not use family planning methods that have hormones, and instead should use another method.</p>
                  <p class="item-title"><strong>Who should avoid family planning that contains the hormone estrogen?</strong></p>
                  <p>Women with:</p>
                  <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>Severe high blood pressure (160/110 or higher).</li>
                    <li>Diabetes for more than 20 years.</li>
                    <li>Over 35-years old and smoke tobacco.</li>
                    <li>Migraines (severe headaches with nausea) if accompanied by numbness, auras, or vision problems.</li>
                    <li>Breast cancer, liver cancer, or uterine cancer.</li>
                    <li>History of stroke (an attack causing paralysis).</li>
                    <li>A blood clot in a vein (this usually causes swelling and pain in one leg).</li>
                    <li>Liver disease or hepatitis.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If any of those describe you, you  can change to and safely use the progestin-only mini pill,  progestin-only birth control implants or injections, or barrier methods.</p>
                  <p>Methods containing estrogen, including the combination pill, aren't the best for women with:</p>
                  <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>High blood pressure (over 140/90).</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>If you have any of these health problems but still use the combination pill or another method with estrogen, ask a health worker to monitor you and show you how to check that your health problems aren't getting worse. If there is no change, keep using it. But if problems get worse, you should change to another method immediately.</p>
                  <p class="content-title">Side effects</p>
                  <p>Side effects from combined hormonal methods are not dangerous but can be annoying. They usually lessen or disappear after about 3 months. Sometimes it helps to try a different brand with different amounts of estrogen or progestin. Side effects include:</p>

                    <li>Changes in mood, such as being sad or irritable.</li>

                  <p>The IUD (Internal Uterine Device) is a small object inserted into the womb by a trained health worker. The IUD makes the womb a place sperm can't fertilize an egg. The IUD can stay in the womb for 3 to 12 years, depending on the type. It must be removed by a health worker. After removal, the woman will be able to get pregnant.</p>

                  <p><strong>Copper IUDs</strong> might cause heavier, more painful menstruation. While uncomfortable, it isn't dangerous and usually lessens after a few months.</p>
                  <p><strong>Hormonal IUDs</strong> often make menstrual flow lighter. Other side effects are spotting, or a little bleeding in the middle of your cycle, or irregular cycles, as well as headaches, breast tenderness, nausea, acne, weight gain, dizziness and mood changes. They usually go away after a few months. </p>

For women, this safe operation is called a tubal ligation, in which the tubes that carry eggs from the ovary to the womb are cut and tied. For men, the safe and simple operation is called a vasectomy, in which the tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the penis is cut and tied. In many countries, these operations are free.

                  <p>The <strong>intrauterine ball</strong> is a new kind of copper IUD. Its shape makes it easier to insert into the uterus.</p>

                  <p><strong>Vasalgel/RISUG</strong> for men is a gel inserted into the man’s tubes to block the flow of sperm from the testicles to the penis.</p>

                  <p><strong>MENT</strong> for men is an implant placed under the skin of a man's arm that releases hormones that stop sperm from developing. </p>
