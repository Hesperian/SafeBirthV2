        A good counselor provides information a woman needs and helps a woman make a good decision. But are all counselors, good counselors? Can you learn to be a better counselor?

      <p>
        This section of the app describes what happens when two women try to get birth control: first a teenager, and then a young married woman. They each visit 3 family planning counselors who give them advice. You will see their questions and the responses of each counselor, and you can select which counselor’s advice you want to follow. When you choose a different counselor, you follow a different path. As you follow each counselor’s advice, think about how each one is responding to the needs being brought to her and how each could better help the person she is counseling.
