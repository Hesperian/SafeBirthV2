      <p>The Method Chooser is a series of questions for you to answer about your experiences, your likes and dislikes, what you are comfortable doing to make your contraception work, and your health history. It will combine your answers to recommend what might be your best options for birth control. You can use these recommendations to learn more about each method in the main section of the app,
        <a href="/pages/">Each method and how it works</a>. And you can then talk with a trusted health worker about getting the contraception method you want.</p>
      <p>The Method Chooser keeps your answers confidential&mdash;no one can find out how you have answered any of these questions!</p>
