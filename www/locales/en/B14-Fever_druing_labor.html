        <p>Injections of hormones are given every 1 to 3 months, depending on the type, usually at a health center or family planning clinic. The protection lasts until you need a new injection.</p>
        <p>Some injections are progestin-only injections, such as <em>Noristerat</em> (given every 2 months) and <em>Depo-Provera</em> (given every 3 months). Progestin-only injections may cause irregular bleeding in the middle of your monthly cycle, but this stops after a few months. Then injections may make menstruation lighter or stop completely.</p>
        <p>Other injections contain both estrogen and progestin, such as <em>Cyclofem</em> and <em>Mesigyna</em>, and are given every month. These injections are good for women who want regular menstruation. Combined injections are more expensive than progestin-only injections.</p>

                  <p>It is best to get the first injection during menstruation. This way you know you are not pregnant. You can start the injections anytime if you are breastfeeding and your menstruation hasn't returned. The injection protects against pregnancy immediately if it is given within 5 days after menstruation begins. If the injection was given 6 or more days after the beginning of menstruation, use condoms or don't have sex for the next 7 days. Follow the schedule for each particular injection:</p>
