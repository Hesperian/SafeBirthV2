        <p>Because women’s bodies can get pregnant, the right to contraception&mdash;the right to decide when you do and do not want to get pregnant&mdash;is central to women’s right to health.</p>
        <p>Women are healthier when they can decide for themselves when to have sex, and if and when to have children. Access to contraception enables women to make those decisions.</p>

                  <p>Don’t panic. First, if you had unprotected sex within 5 days, you can use <a href="/pages/C24.5-Emergency_contraception/">emergency pills</a> to prevent getting pregnant. If your period is late, you can get an inexpensive test that will tell you if you are pregnant. If you are pregnant but don't want to be, you can interrupt your pregnancy with a safe abortion (see Hesperian’s Safe Abortion app). What is important is to move quickly&mdash;every option available to you is simpler and works better the sooner you use it.</p>

                  <p>Some people think birth control is only for married women, that single women shouldn't have sex. But both married and unmarried people have sex, and many women want to be able to enjoy sex without worrying about getting pregnant. Also, women don't always have a choice about having sex. Some are pressured, and some are forced. Without family planning, any woman, married or unmarried, young or older, can get pregnant. Anyone who wants to prevent pregnancy can benefit from family planning. If you are a health worker, it is important that you share what you know about family planning with all women. Helping men understand the benefits of family planning can help them overcome their fears about it and understand how family planning helps them too.</p>

                  <p>To increase how wet your vagina gets, you can try several things. First, have your partner slow down his love-making and give you time to get aroused. Second, try using a lubricant. There are many kinds available, and you can find one that works with your birth control. Don’t use an oil-based lubricant with latex condoms and don’t use silicone-based lubricants with diaphragms or cervical caps. Water-based lubricants can be used with any method. Finally, you can see if a pill that contains more estrogen helps with your wetness and doesn’t cause any other problem side effects. Or you can change to a non-hormonal method completely.</p>

                  <p>While sex education classes love to have you put a condom on a banana, the fact is that not all condoms fit everyone. If a condom comes off during sex, or feels like it might, the problem isn’t with you or your guy&mdash;it’s with the condom. There are different sizes and kinds of condoms and they are all fairly inexpensive, so try different brands if you are having problems with a loose condom. When condoms are too tight or just don’t fit well, they can hurt or distract the man, make sex less enjoyable, and cause his penis to get less hard&mdash;which might make the condom come off! And for about ⅓ of all men, a smaller size condom fits better than the standard size. Try different sizes, styles and brands. Finding a condom that makes you and your partner happy is also a good way to stop him from complaining about using one. If a condom comes off during sex, you can still protect yourself, see <a href="/pages/C24.5-Emergency_contraception/">emergency pills</a>.</p>

                  <p>It helps to be clear before you start that the only way you will have sex is if he wears a condom. Communication is important in a relationship, even a very brief one. You can say that sex won't be pleasurable for you if you have to worry about getting pregnant or getting an STI. Promise that the sex will be amazing for both of you, and the condom will let both of you focus on each other instead of worrying. And if you have some condoms available, you won’t have to depend on him bringing them.</p>

                  <p>While this can happen, it isn't common. If you can feel it out of place, then you can re-adjust before continuing, but in the middle of sex it might not be possible. The spermicide you use with a diaphragm or cervical cap lessens the possibility that this kind of accident will lead to pregnancy, but do the same thing as when a condom breaks to be sure. Putting in a <a href="/pages/C29.1-Diaphragm/">diaphragm</a> or a <a href="/pages/C29.2-Cervical_cap/">cervical cap</a> properly takes practice, so do it several times before using it for real.</p>
