        <p>Spermicide comes in different forms&mdash;foam, tablets, cream, jelly, film&mdash;and is put into the vagina just before having sex. Spermicide prevents pregnancy by killing the man’s sperm or slowing it down so it can't get to the womb. While it can be used by itself, it is more effective and more often used along with another method, such as a diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap or condom.</p>

                  <p>Insert spermicide deep into the vagina (using the applicator if there is one) from 10 minutes up to 1 hour before sex, depending on the type. Some women find spermicides cause itching or irritation in the vagina. The irritation may lead to tiny cuts in the vaginal wall which could allow HIV to enter the body more easily. If you wash your vagina, wait for 6 hours after sex before doing so.</p>
