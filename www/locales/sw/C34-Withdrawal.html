        <p>When a man pulls his penis out of the woman and away from her genitals before he ejaculates, this is called withdrawal. Withdrawal is better than no method, but does not always work. Sometimes a man does not pull out in time, and even if he does, some liquid containing sperm can leak from his penis before ejaculation and cause pregnancy. The chance of getting pregnant is high.</p>
